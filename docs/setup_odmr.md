# Introduction

A typical working toolchain consists out of the following qudi modules:

logic:

hardware:

gui:


# Example config

These modules need to be configured and connected in your qudi config file.
We here provide an examplary config for a toolchain based on a NI X-series scanner with analogue output and digital (APD TTL) input.
Note: This readme file might not be up-to-date with the most recent development. We advice to check the examplary config present in the
